This beginner-level open competition from Kaggle opened up the doors for our first steps in the _UM - Data Team Club_ to get to work with GAN models.

## Challenges

Definetely the requirements for installing tensorflow and specially the tensorflow-addons. Navigating throught the multiple versions of python, tensorflow itself, idisplay, etc. in order for our team to be able to even install it. 
In this Odyssey we crossed paths with this [compatibility matrix on github](https://github.com/tensorflow/addons#python-op-compatibility-matrix) that shed a light on the restrictions we should abide to.

Our model consists of the imagined two components, a Generator model and a Discriminator.

We have found information about the structure they should have in order to fulfill our purpose, as the image shows below:
